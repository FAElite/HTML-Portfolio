<h1>The Best Movies According to Furqan</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>This movie was the finale of 23 Marvel films.
   It not only had a edge of seat plot, it also
   went down memory lane filling the screens with nastolgia
   of all the previous movies.
</p>

<h3>Shang Chi</h3>
<p>I know this is another Marvel movie but it's just amazing.
   Simple html words are not going to suffice when describing
   this movie. From the story, to the visuals, to the soundtracks.
   It's one of the best movies released since Endgame.
</p>

<h3>Avatar- The Way of Water</h3>
<p>Do I even have to say anything about this? It's the
   sequel of the highest grossing film ever made. It's the third
   highest grossing (behiend the first movie and Endgem) for 
   obvious reasons. Stunning visuals, arguable the best there ever was,
   and mind numbing plot.
